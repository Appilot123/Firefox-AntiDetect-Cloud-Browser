<h1 align="center">Firefox AntiDetect Cloud Browser</h1>

## Project Overview:

This project is a lightweight, private anti-detect browser built on **non-Chromium architecture** (specifically Firefox) designed for high-performance automation use cases like web scraping, account farming, and CTR manipulation. It’s aimed at developers and marketers tired of bloated, overpriced, or opaque solutions like Dolphin Anty and Incogniton. The browser runs in local or cloud environments with unlimited profile support, API access, and stealth browsing features—without relying on Chromium’s common fingerprint patterns.


## Core Features:
- **Non-Chromium Fingerprinting:** Unlike most tools, this browser avoids Chromium’s fingerprint clusters entirely—making it much harder to detect via traditional tracking tools.
- **Cloud-Ready Profile System:** Profiles can be spun up and managed in the cloud or locally with zero limitations and automated via API.
- **Performance Optimized:** Lightweight, fast, and uses significantly less RAM than existing commercial options—ideal for high-scale automation environments.

| Feature                      | Description                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Non-Chromium Base            | Built using Firefox engine for TLS spoofing and unique fingerprinting.                          |
| Unlimited Profile Management | Run unlimited virtual browser profiles simultaneously (locally or cloud).                       |
| API Access                   | Fully controllable via custom APIs for automation, scraping, or bot orchestration.              |
| Fingerprint Spoofing         | Custom spoofing of WebGL, canvas, TLS, timezone, user agent, etc.                               |
| RAM-Efficient Architecture   | Optimized to run on minimal system resources compared to competitors.                           |
| Device Fingerprint Isolation | Each profile has unique hardware/software fingerprint emulation.                                |
| Automation Friendly          | Designed for seamless bot control through tools like Python, Playwright, or Puppeteer wrappers. |
| Profile Persistence          | Deleted profiles aren’t purged—can be re-used or re-attached from storage.                      |
| Local & Cloud Ready          | Option to deploy locally for full control, or in cloud with optional storage add-ons.           |
| Security Focus               | No telemetry, no 3rd-party phone-home behavior, fully self-contained environment.               |
